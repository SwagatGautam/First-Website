                <h2>About Technology</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology is use of of scientific knowledge for our practical
                    purposes whether it be for our own benifit or for the industry.
                    Technology is all around us and in everything we do. It has a
                    significant impact on how we live. It is a practical knowledge that
                    solves our problems. Technology perhaps has changed our world in
                    many ways. It has made life easier.<br /><br />The word technology
                    comes from two greek words "Techne" and "Logos" where Techne means
                    art, skills, or craft and Logos means a word, saying or expression
                    that expresses inward thoughts. Thus, all in all technology means
                    the skill to communicate an idea to reach a paticular goal. Nowadays
                    we understand technology as only gadgets which is entirely false. As
                    I've mentioned earlier technology has helped human race in many
                    terms. Various evolutions have occured in this field. From the time
                    it started till now, it has made a huge impact on our lives in
                    various ways, for example we can now have the ability to change our
                    environment, interconnect the various societies and even explore
                    many wonders of the universe itself. Today as we are living, we are
                    using technology in each step of our life from morning to night, for
                    example from the simplest thing like the scissor or nail cutter to
                    our personal laptop, our mobile phones, T.V etc. Technology is seen
                    in our homes, in our offices, in schools, hospitals etc. Technology
                    has touched all aspects of our life whether it be our kitchen
                    microwave, remote control, fridge, water heaters or other larger
                    systems like internet facilities, railways, air transportation and
                    so on. thus technology plays extremely crucial role in human lives.

                <h2>Positive impact of technology on both life and business</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology has advanced so much that to think our lives without
                    technology is simply crazy. It has made our life comfortale, easier
                    and very much enjoyable. It's like technology does 90% of the work
                    for us as it has reduced the effort and time to complete a respetive
                    task, not only that it enhances the quality and organization of work
                    than we humans do. Technology, hence, has been a part of our lives
                    and has benifitted us in many ways possible.<br /><br />Today, we
                    communicate from where we are to any place we would like to
                    communiate, ommuniation has become much faster and easier. We are
                    just one click away from people we would like to communicate with.
                    Likewise in education, espeially during COVID-19 breakdown
                    period,technology was so much help. If it wasn't for the technology,
                    the time, which is very important for both children and teacher both
                    would be wasted, becasue of technolgy online teaching was brought up
                    through which many students got to learn and resume their studies
                    through online classes. Technology helped people to share their
                    various knowledge through online platforms. Students were able to
                    understand much attentively in a visual manner with the help of
                    diagrams, 3D animation, graphics etc. Technology is also known as
                    driving force behind various improvements in medical and healthcare
                    feild. Modern machines have helped the specilist to perform their
                    tasks smoothly and sucessfully. We now can know if we have any
                    complication with our health, we can now increase the life span of
                    people by curing them in time through technology. There are other
                    amny sectors that technology has been efficiently used such as in
                    banking sector, automation, offices, automobile, and various
                    industries, where technology is making huge impact on changes in
                    human life.<br /><br />As technology keeps on advancing the role of
                    business grows accordingly. In many businesses technology has helped
                    to support ecternal customers services efforts as well as each
                    individuals with in the organization. globlalization is easier as
                    now a business can reach out its potentials worldwide. Means of
                    communication done for business is faster and effective as ever.
                    Technology has helped employees stay employed throughout the
                    pandamic period too. Both big business and small business completely
                    rely on technology.

                <h2>Negative impact of technology on both life and business</h2>
                <p>
                    We don't only have positive aspects when it comes to technology, it
                    also ultimately comes with some negtive aspects. Disadvantages of
                    technology may be minimal percentage but we sure can't ignore it for
                    example, robots and machines have left many workers unemplyoyeed as
                    they are seen to be taking ther jobs. One click away is a very smart
                    and undoubtedly easier concept for people wanting to do any type of
                    task, yet it makes people socially isolated as they can be seen
                    spending more time on their technology then physically involving
                    with people around them. Technology also have spoiled students in
                    many way as their intellectual and analytical skills are decreasing.
                    It is almost like spoon feeding students as they can copy any
                    knowlegde from website. Their reasoning and talent skills to think
                    differently is also reducing. While making online bank transaction
                    people have to be extra cautious as they can be hacked anytime. Many
                    hackings about social medias are a hot burning topic in today's era.
                    People can hack easilY and leak our peronal information very easily.
                    Technology can also enhance itself and even replace products and
                    activities that are near and dear to us.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology is the greatest discovery ever done by human race and
                    this is what that makes our lives easier than it could have ever
                    been. Technology has literally devoted so many things to humans from
                    the simplest things to the complex machines. If not for the
                    technology, we can't even imagine how our lives would turn out to
                    be. But to be able to build a better world technology alone cannot
                    be enough. The secure collaboration effort of both machines and
                    humans is strictly needed to progress and prosper our nation. We
                    might not know the future of technology, as it seems very exiting
                    but in the same way very scary. In the future technology will no
                    doubt focus on robots, artificial intelligence, machine learning
                    etc. No matter how the future of technology turns out to be, we
                    should always be the one controlling them as well as using them for
                    the good use only. Hence, we need to build a strong management
                    system for efficiient fuctioning of technology.
